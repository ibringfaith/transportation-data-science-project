Our research question: What weeks of the year experience the highest number of car crashes, and how strongly are these crashes correlated with the weather conditions?
We found that week 25 shows a statistically significant number of car crashes compared to other weeks; however, these crashes are unlikely to be correlated to a single weather condition.
